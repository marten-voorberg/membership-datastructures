This respository contains the code needed to reproduce the experiments conducted in my BSc. thesis. The paper itself can be found in `paper.pdf`. Important files are:
- `data-generation/data-generation.py`. This file is used to generate the data sets with which the experiments will be conducted.
- `src/datastructures` contains the source code of the evaluated data structures.
- `src/experiment` contains the files needed to run the experiments.
- `output` contains the scripts needed to evaluate the results.
